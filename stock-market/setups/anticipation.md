# Anticipation

## Bullish Anticipation

- established uptrend
  - linear first leg if looking as continuation setup - stock should go up smoothly and not in volatile manner
- consolidating near its high (sideways)
  - series of narrow range days in pullback - look for extremely tight action
  - orderly pullback with no 4% breakdown
  - low volume and volatility during pullback
  - 3 to 10d pullback
  - best to avoid a stock going sideways for more than a month - need breakout to resume trend in those cases
- narrow range last 3d
  - not up 3d in a row
- high volume breakout 4%+ can lead to 8-40% swing

## Trading Anticipation Setups

- Make money on more trades (hundreds) that move account in smaller increments of 0.5-5%

### Suggested Process Flow

- should be efficient and done daily after market close
- only 3-5 quality ideas should be tracked
- "A" grade pre-momentum burst setup should be your first priority
- narrow done to 1 to 5 for next day action
- quality is more important than quantity

### How to Find Anticipation Setups

- DT, TI65, MDT scans
- to anticipate a breakout, look at stocks currently not undergoing momentum burst
- stock should be in extremely low momentum phase
- it can be a shallow pullback in established momentum phase
- look for stock with extremely low volatility
- a stock with low volatility in last 5 to 10d is ideal candidate as part of a continuation setup
- look for series of low range bars in last 5 to 10d
- look for stocks with Bollinger band squeeze
- avoid anticipation setups on extended stocks
- 1st or 2nd anticipation setup in established trend is best
- extended trneds need to be avoided as failure is high on them
- look for early entry on anticipation candidates
- Anticipating a breakout helps you get an early entry and can improve your per trade profits. It can also lower your risk as your stop is close. It can help you profit from even smaller moves.
