# EP (Episodic Pivots)

- **Game-changing catalyst**: New information (revenue, EPS, new product, government policy change, etc.) is made available to the market, leading to a re-evaluation of the current trend. This can launch or reverse a rally and last months, even years.
- **Do EP research daily** in the mornings or evenings.

## Trading EPs

- 9 million EP (big volume)
- Look to enter at **start of the swing move**
- Make money on fewer trades that move your account in larger increments of 10-100% - needs wider stops and higher skills

## Explosive Moves

When earnings season starts, many companies will beat earnings. Some will go up 20-40% in a few days post earnings. These are small moves more suitable for swing trades.

EP candidates will have explosive moves. If you see explosive earnings growth in a neglected stock (no liquidity, no analyst coverage, no meaningful gain in last couple of years), an explosive move will follow. These are the kind of opportunities to focus on during earnings season. For that, you have to find out which companies are releasing earnings before open or after hours and then look at the outlier in earnings or sales growth on extremely neglected stocks.

You just need one or two trades like this in an earnings season to make your year or change your financial situation forever. And all it takes to find these stocks is 15 minutes of systemic work of going through earnings and stock that gap up after hours or premarket.

## Entering and Exiting

- Enter after hours or premarket if you have high risk tolerance, as sometimes the moves will fade.
- Enter at open with $0.40-$1 stop.
- Entering after 15 minutes is less risky, but you might miss some gains.
- Exit on trailing stops. Trail by $0.40-$1, and then $0.20-$0.40 as the stock moves in your favor.
- Although some of these moves continue for days, weeks, months, or years, many of them fade after the first 1-2 hours. Go with a day trade mindset unless research indicates it might be a multi-day move.
