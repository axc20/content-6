# Swing Trading

## Setups

- Focus on **$ b/o** - they offer you opportunities to risk bigger per trade. Stop dreaming about doubling money in a few trades. While it is possible, one must everyday focus on finding them and at same time keep on collecting small profits. It will give you the ability to risk big on a few select trades and guarantees you will make money year after year.
- If you are trading a momentum burst kind of phenomenon, you want the trade to rocket off immediately. **Keep close stops and sell into strength.**

## Risk

- Strive to keep per trade loss as low as possible. If you can keep your losses small, you will have a better mood to trade and can take several trades without going through emotional up and downs. It does not matter if you have a lot of wash trades - you close immediately if they do not work.

## Trade Profit

- If you want big returns, once you perfect your setup and have a track record of over 100-200 trades with 50-60% win rate, then you can increase your per position size and your results will improve.
- Understand the maths of swing tading and active trading, and you will know which variable to control. If your win rate is low, focus on setup quality. If your per trade profit is low, focus on either improving it or increasing the number of trades.
