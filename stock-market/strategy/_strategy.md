# Strategy

If you want to be consistently profitable and outperform, you shouldn't be looking to outperform when it does well. You should want to outperform the market in bad years. That's where the money is to be made/preserved, and that's how you get a much higher CAGR (compound annual growth rate) long-term.

## Clear Objectives

Set clear objectives. **Be a leader** when it comes to your money.

- Process-oriented trade factory
- Learn and understand the methods (both the how and the why). Perfect their execution without doing too much damage to your account (protect capital!).
- Make lots of money (triple digit plus) with least possible risk (2.5% or less) in all market conditions. `Risk = Entry - Stop`, so for a $10k trade, max loss is $250.
- Buy **setups** not stocks. Train yourself to only focus on valid setups, and do not buy or sell random stocks. Maximize your edges in the market: setup, timing, quality, speed, healthcare and tech (ususually biggest winners after initial bounce).
- Stock market automation: Automate research and analysis to reduce future effort and time costs.

## Understand Setups

Not all setups are the equally important. Some setups find big moves. Some setups are good for swing trading.

- **Life Changing Setups (big moves)**:
  - EP, 9 million
- **Free Money Setups**:
  - Ants, A3T, Top25, Reversals
  - Use small stops `< 2.5` and time stop
- **Endless Possibilities Setups**:
  - 4%, $, LTB, strong/weak structure, day trade

A setup is just an idea. Unless you think deeply about it and convert it into a **process**, it does not become part of your **procedural memory**. Your task as a trader is to develop this procedural memory - to develop enough expertise to execute that setup on your own without any help. Study, learn, and practice a few important setups, and stop flirting from one setup to another.

### Example of Procedural Memory: Trading Breakouts

1. Scan daily
2. Identify good setups from scans
3. Put stop
4. Determine position size
5. Determine target
6. Exit

Individual trades do not matter. **Learn process flows**. If you learn process flow, you will be able to replicate a trade or understand what is involved in finding a trade. Once you become process oriented, the cognitive load will decrease.

### Study

Just do one thing daily without fail. **Study stocks that are up 20% for a week and up 100% for a year.** Everything you need to make money, you will learn from that.

You need to understand the nature of stock moves, how they start, how they progress, and how they reverse.

By doing this **daily without fail**, you will have a working model of what works in the _current market_. Then you can start designing scans to find them. This study will help you develop "your own understanding" of market moves.

Study:

- Bullish 20%: `c/c5 >= 1.2` an `minv3.1 > 100000` and `c >= 5`
- Bearish 20%: `c/c5 < 0.8` an `minv3.1 > 100000` and `c >= 5`
- If trading low priced stocks, you can eliminate the last condition of `c >= 5`
