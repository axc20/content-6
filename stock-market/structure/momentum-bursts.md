## Absolute Momentum

Relative momentum types ranks stocks by relative rant to other stocks or an index.

- TI65 (avgc7/avgc65)
- TI21 (c/avgc21)
- MDT (c/avgc126)

Absolute momentum does not rank stock in relation to others but identifies the direction and strength of momentum. Absolute momentum compares a stock's current momentum to its past momentum.

- TI65 >= 1.05
- MDT >= 1.19
- M20 (c/minc21) >= 1.2
- 4% b/o
- $ b/o
- DT (c/minl252) >= 1.8

Absolute momentum tells you when a stock is in a momentum phase, and it also tells you the velocity of the momentum move. Absolute momentum allows you to identify the start of a momentum phase and get on the trend earlier.
