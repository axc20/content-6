# Strategy

## Process

- **Develop a process loop and run it**
- Think through a **setup** idea:
  - entry, exit
  - timeframe
  - how much to risk
- Each setup you want to trade needs a process loop to be run during the day. The process loop allows you to make money out of the setup. It becomes part of you, and instinctively, you can figure out whether it is a good setup or not.
- Stick to a few setup ideas, and do the same thing every day until you become an expert on that setup. Run your process loop, and **fine tune** it again and again.
- Process loops will stop you from flirting from methd to method. It helps you develop **procedural memory** - it becomes an automated task, and your brain spends a very small amount of energy to do it. If your efforts at training procedural memory are successful, then you will become efficient in trading.

## Execution

- don't buy stocks up 3 days in a row
- sell into strength (gap ups)
- make use of MOO (market on open) and MOC (market on close) orders, and stops
