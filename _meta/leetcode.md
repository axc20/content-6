  - General Recursion
    - Backtracking
  - Trees
    - BT/BST
    - N-Ary Trees
- Tier 3
  - Graphs
    - Traversal Algos BFS/DFS
    - Sorting (Topological Sort)
    - Disjoint Sets
  - Dynamic Programing (start with 1D, then move to 2D)
    - Top Down
    - Bottom Up

## Study Plan

1. Look at list of patterns on [Grokking coding interview](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-coding-interview)
2. Pick one pattern, search for LC problems with that pattern
3. Go through each problem for the pattern, and go STRAIGHT to the solution (do not even spend 1 second trying to solve the problem)
4. Understand the solution DEEPLY: make notes, google things, watch videos, go to discusssion section, play around with solution
5. Move on to next problem, and repeat
6. Repetition is key: after you have done this for enough problems, you will feel a lightbulb going off in your head
7. Go back and pick a new pattern, and do the same thing
