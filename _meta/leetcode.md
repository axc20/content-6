# Leetcode

## Pass LC Filter

- **Understand and recognize the 15-20 patterns.**
  - Get the basics of data structures down, and know the time complexity of operations. 90% of the time, heap, set, or map is the way to go, and you can usually figure out which one the question wants by thinking about time complexities.
  - Python is good for leetcode because it is fast to iterate, has loose typing, and the array/string slicing trivializes a lot of common operations.
- You want to be able to quickly see a problem and think:
  1. What is the input?
  2. What is the expected output?
  3. "I could probably solve this with X."
- Solve any **medium** in under 20 minutes while being able to explain what you're doing. Most of the time should be spent **talking** and **designing** - what optimal algorithm may look like, what data structures to use, etc. Coding is the easiest/fastest part. Run a couple test cases on your own, and include edge cases.
- Use **REACTO** to explaing your thinking process as you tackle the problem:
  - **Repeat** question
  - Come up with **examples**
  - Outline your **approach**
  - **Code** your solution
  - **Test** your code (manually run through it if on whiteboard)
  - Then, and only then, **optimize**
- **A LC problem a day** for the next few months is better than cramming. Less stressful and you're absorbing the patterns better over a longer period of time. You could even structure it to focus on one pattern a week (look up 14 leetcode patterns). DO NOT code right away - always plan it out on paper, account for every scenario, and then code!

## Patterns

- Tier 1
  - Sliding Window/Two Pointers
  - Binary Search
  - Arrays/Strings
  - Sorting
- Tier 2
  - Heaps
    - Min/Max Heap
    - Two Heap Method
  - Stacks/Queues
  - General Recursion
    - Backtracking
  - Trees
    - BT/BST
    - N-Ary Trees
- Tier 3
  - Graphs
    - Traversal Algos BFS/DFS
    - Sorting (Topological Sort)
    - Disjoint Sets
  - Dynamic Programing (start with 1D, then move to 2D)
    - Top Down
    - Bottom Up

## Study Plan

1. Look at list of patterns on [Grokking coding interview](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-coding-interview)
2. Pick one pattern, search for LC problems with that pattern
3. Go through each problem for the pattern, and go STRAIGHT to the solution (do not even spend 1 second trying to solve the problem)
4. Understand the solution DEEPLY: make notes, google things, watch videos, go to discusssion section, play around with solution
5. Move on to next problem, and repeat
6. Repetition is key: after you have done this for enough problems, you will feel a lightbulb going off in your head
7. Go back and pick a new pattern, and do the same thing
