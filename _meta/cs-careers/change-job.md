Your connections, relationships, ability to pass an interview and talk about the tech, and any things you can show off matter 1000% more than your ability to code (in this order)! **Min-maxing for interview skills will put you ahead of people who are min-maxing for job skills.**

Generally speaking, the big bucks is not aligned with a specific language/framework/tool but rather methods/approaches/paradigms that are difficult to master and hire for - asynchronous program design, queue-based architectures, gRPC, distributed task processing, distributed compute administration, threading, highly responsive and interactive interfaces, low latency systems, etc.

Hiring managers are looking for strong knowledge in stack-agnostic best practices, patterns, and architectures and strong soft skills (communication, team work, leadership).
