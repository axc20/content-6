## Connect with Interviewer

- Connect with interviewer, but avoid being _too succinct or blunt_. Present your story in a compelling fashion - paint a picture of a developer that can uniquely contribute XYZ and a sense of growth (rapid learning curve).
  - People remember the arc of a highly motivated and talented indivdual who tackled successively more difficult milestones along the way to their current position.
  - Tell stories that emphasize your ability to work in team or solve problems.
- Research the position, and appear passionate about it (company/product/team). Research and drop industry keywords. Research the company and drop a fun fact you remembered.
- You will need to do some bullshitting. Stretch the truth, as you often have nothing to lose. However, make sure you can back it up. Put a positive spin on everything you say.
- Have good soft skills. Have a couple years of experience, and be able to talk about your experience in a good light. Hopefully, you had a large impact on any projects you worked on. Be someone enjoyable that they _want_ to work with. Learn to ask good questions that show you are interested.
