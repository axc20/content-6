## Connect with Interviewer

- Connect with interviewer, but avoid being _too succinct or blunt_. Present your story in a compelling fashion - paint a picture of a developer that can uniquely contribute XYZ and a sense of growth (rapid learning curve).
  - People remember the arc of a highly motivated and talented indivdual who tackled successively more difficult milestones along the way to their current position.
  - Tell stories that emphasize your ability to work in team or solve problems.
- Research the position, and appear passionate about it (company/product/team). Research and drop industry keywords. Research the company and drop a fun fact you remembered.
- You will need to do some bullshitting. Stretch the truth, as you often have nothing to lose. However, make sure you can back it up. Put a positive spin on everything you say.
- Have good soft skills. Have a couple years of experience, and be able to talk about your experience in a good light. Hopefully, you had a large impact on any projects you worked on. Be someone enjoyable that they _want_ to work with. Learn to ask good questions that show you are interested.

## HR

- Not the time to tell the truth. Why are you looking to leave? "I wasn't, but this opportunity looked incredibly interesting, and I felt like it was something I needed to explore. I found a great opportunity."
- "I'm interested in growing my current career, and I think \[company\] offers a lot of potential for growth opportunities."
- "I worry that I'll stagnate in my current position, and I'm looking for a company with more defined pathways for growth and advancement."
- **Example**: Why do I want to work for facebook? Because Facebook is a place where your product can impact the most basic building block of society, the way two people interact with each other. Facebook gives individuals the opportunity to connect with millions and change the course of history. Facebook also has a reputation for having a great technical culture. I am looking to advance my career to a more senior position and solving problems at Facebook scale will give me the opportunity to build the skills necessary for that advancement.
