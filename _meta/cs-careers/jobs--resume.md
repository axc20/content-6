# Resume

- My pattern is to get a job doing technology A, spend my working hours on technology A, spend my free hours learning technology B and C, then put technologies A, B, and C on my resume as being part of my job. So on paper I have X years experience with A, B, and C, even though I've only done A at my actual job.
- Describe your responsibilities and achievements using **action verbs** like "managed", "developed", and "increased" to make your resume dynamic and engaging.
  - "Managed a team of 5 designers, resulting in a 50% increase in project efficiency."
  - "Accomplished X, as measured by Y (impact it had), doing Z": "Launched X project 1 month ahead of schedule and increasing ROI by Z%, by creating a new communication process that allowed low and medium risk tickets to be pre-approved, reducing friction during development"
- Provide specific **examples and metrics** to demonstrate the impact of your work. This helps to make your achievements more concrete and memorable. Illustrate that you undestand what you're working on and why, what's challenging about it, scale, complexity, etc.
- Mention technology (must be in first 5 if in a list) and accomplishment using it
- Ensure it is readable line by line by Applicant Tracking Software - test on websites that give it ATS score
- Can fluff resume (but be reasonable - it should be something you know)
  - For example, if you know enough about a popular frontend or backend library, you can say you made an internal tool for the company or team.
