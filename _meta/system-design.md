# System Design

System design refers to the process of defining a system's components - architecture, modules, components, interfaces, and data. The process of defining, creating, and designing systems that suit the particular objectives and requirements of an organization is what you need to understand when it comes to system design.

1. Performance vs. Scalability
2. Latency vs. Throughput and Availability vs. Consistency (with patterns)
3. Availability patterns
4. Background jobs
5. Domain name systems
6. CDNs
7. Load Balancers
8. Caching
9. Asynchronism
10. Communication patterns
11. Performance antipatterns
12. Monitoring
13. Cloud design patterns

**Tip:** Use generative AI to assist in your understanding of system design concepts. It can synthesize answers for you without you having to scour the Internet yourself, and you are also able to ask specific follow-up questions. However, you will need to be diligent about verifying the information yourself should you have doubts.
