  - **Continuous Integration (CI)** refers to the practice that requires developers to integrate code into a shared repository several times a day. Each check-in is then verified by an automated build/script, allowing teams to detect problems early. When you commit code to your repo, you can continuously build and test code to make sure that the commit doesn't introduce errors. Tests can include code linters, security checks, code coverage, functional tests, and other custom checks. Building and testing your code requires a server. You can build and test updates locally before pushing code to a repo, or you can use a CI server that checks for new code commits in a repo.
  - **Continuous Deployment (CD)** refers to the release into production of software that passes the automated tests.
