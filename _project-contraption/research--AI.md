GPT models are actually **reasoning engines** not knowledge databases. This predicts that advances in the usefulness of AI will come from advances in its ability to access the right knowledge at the right time - not just from advances in its reasoning powers.

GPT-4's performance improves dramatically the second it has access to the right information. When GPT-4 is hooked up to the internet (or anything that acts like a database), it doesn't have to rely on its fuzzy statistical understanding. It can retrieve explicit facts and use that to create its answer.

1. Knowledge databases are as important to AI progress as foundational models.
2. People who organize, store, and catalog their own thinking and reading will have a leg up in an AI-driven world. They can make those resources available to the model and use it to enhance the intelligence and relevance of its responses.
